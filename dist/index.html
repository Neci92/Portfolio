          <p>I have started learning web development out of
            curiosity and realized that I want to live out of it.
            Currently, I am working on landing a first developer job
            and simultaneously expanding my skills to become full-stack JavaScript developer. And after that? Well there's a bunch of
            programming languages and I want to learn
            them all! C#, you better take care!

          <h2>My teachers</h2>
          <h4> Youtube, Udemy, coding sites and more</h4>
          <p>Internet is such a wondeful place. It provided me with bunch of resources for personal development. My favorite teacher is the most definitely <span class="text-secondary">Bucky Roberts (thenewboston.com)</span>! Unfortunately he is not publishing new tutorials but his youtube channel is still great for learning core concepts of some new technology. Brad Traversy and Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller are teachers from <span class="text-secondary">Udemy</span> that helped me with their projects to understand the whole web development process. When I started to learn web development my first step was made in <span class="text-secondary">Codecademy</span>  and after that <span class="text-secondary">freeCodeCamp</span>  and <span class="text-secondary">Team Treehouse</span>. These platforms have given me solution to my problems with understanding a theory. Currently fixing problems now is much easier for me because I prefer to read <span class="text-secondary">documentation</span> of a technology I'm using or check documentation on
          <span class="text-secondary"> W3Schools/MDN</span>  for HTML/CSS/JS.  </p>

          <h2>My Skills</h2>
          <h4>Hey Nemanja, What do you know? </h4>
          <p><span class="text-secondary">HTML</span>, <span class="text-secondary">CSS</span> and <span class="text-secondary">JavaScript</span>! Well it's not just that. I am familiar with <span class="text-secondary">Jade</span>, but I prefer plain HTML. With CSS is totally different story! I love <span class="text-secondary">Sass/Less</span> ! They help me to style my site much faster and to experiment easily with custom color themes. Also, I adore CSS frameworks, <span class="text-secondary">Bootstrap</span> and <span class="text-secondary">Materialize</span> especially, but I have a grasp of
          <span class="text-secondary">Bulma</span>, <span class="text-secondary">Foundation</span> and <span class="text-secondary">Skeleton</span>. <span class="text-secondary">Vanilla JavaScript</span> and <span class="text-secondary">jQuery</span> are great, but lately I've been using <span class="text-secondary">TypeScript</span> due to working on <span class="text-secondary">Angular</span> apps. For installing packages I prefer
          <span class="text-secondary">npm</span>, but I could also use <span class="text-secondary">bower</span> and <span class="text-secondary">yarn</span>. Taskrunner of my choice is <span class="text-secondary">gulp.js</span> with plug-ins for minification, concatination or image optimization.
          <br>
          Development can be really a painful experience if you don't have a clear picture of what you're doing. For creating vision of my site I use <span class="text-secondary">Figma</span>.

          <h2>Future development</h2>
          <h4>IT Academy - Microsoft software developer</h4>
          <p>I have enrolled in <span class="text-secondary">IT Academy - Microsoft development</span> course that starts in November. Goal of this course is to get comfortable with writing web and desktop applications. In year to come I will be working on gaining knowledge in <span class="text-secondary">C#(ASP.Net MVC and all prerequisites), SQL programming and administration, software engineering </span>etc.</p>
          <p>
          <a href="http://www.aloeveraflp.rs" class="text-secondary">Aloeveraflp.rs </a>is the first site I built and really needs update. I am currently working on conversation of that static site in full-operational web application. Therefore my plan is to complete my <span class="text-secondary"> Angular </span> knowledge and to gain firm knowledge in <span class="text-secondary">MongoDB/Mongoose </span> and <span class="text-secondary">Node/Express.js</span>
